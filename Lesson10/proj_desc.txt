Create a program named property_address.py, including the following:

The custom exceptions StateError and ZipCodeError

Class Address that takes 
    name, 
    street_address, 
    city, 
    state, and 
    zip_code 
as string arguments, which must then be set as attributes.
You may turn any or all of these attributes into properties in order to solve 
    this assignment as long as the also meet these requirements:
        
    After being set in __init__, the name attribute is read-only.
    Further attempts to modify it will trigger an AttributeError.

    Zip code must follow the simple US pattern (nnnnn) or it throws a ZipCode error.

    State only allows 2 capital letters or it throws a StateError

State and Zip code validation must be done by regular expressions.
